  <!-- About -->

  <div class="about">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Today people are accumulating in their homes piles of books they have purchased over the years. It's definitely
      nice to create your own library in the living room, but in most cases, no one plans to reread them in the future.
      At the same time, there could be difficulty in getting the book you want. We probably all have a library in our
      area of ​​residence. Still, in most cases, it will contain popular reading books and not necessarily what we are
      looking for, especially when it comes to a particular professional niche. So the options available to me are not
      so convenient - either to spend money on it or reach out to a community involved in the niche, like a Facebook
      group and ask if anyone has the book.</p>
    <h2>Desing</h2>
    <p>In designing the app, I was guided by a clear line - to create an experience that feels like a book. I took the
      black-on-white element from the regular printed book pages we are all familiar with and embedded it throughout the
      screens. The design is sharp, clean, clear, without much shading and embossing, like a paper sheet. However, the
      app gets its color from the books themselves. The whole stage belongs to the books, and each cover gives its hue
      and character.</p>
    <h2>Prototype</h2>
    <p>This is the main screen which contains all the books that you can borrow from others. There are various filtering
      options at the top of the screen that opens and closes according to the scrolling.</p>
